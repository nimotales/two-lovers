# When Never had a dream about Forever seeking Nothing in Everything

Once upon a time when Never had a dream of Forever, Never wanted to move
life in the name of Love Forever, for Everything was given a Nothing for
Never to chase Forever a Love like Never before.

Ocean's mother, Tchesca, once said that she had a dream about her
husband. She had fun ways to mention the way they met.

Tchesca used to do sympathetic crafts, an ancient way of making prayers
by tailoring cotton hoping to find a Love for Life. The methods are
known only by God and his benevolence. She and her siblings believed
that a true love for life could be randomly found in a random place when
the natural forces collide.

Josef was a bold man, very enthusiastic about working and travelling
around the world. Tchesca had a dream about him, and as funny as it
seems she thought he wouldn't be very handsome but would have the
strength to get her from her family to build a new family from Love.

One day Tchesca told Ocean that she would meet Josef after a few
sympathetic crafts. One in special, she tied a firefly on her bedsheet
before going to sleep as she thought to dream about Love. Fun fact, it
worked for her and her siblings, at least it is what I think.

For me Everything is possible with the Everything spirit. If you have
Nothing but love, and believe you can find something from Everything,
sympathetic crafts can work amazingly... for this is all about belief.
