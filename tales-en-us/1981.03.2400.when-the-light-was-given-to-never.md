# When the Light was given to Never

Once upon a time Never and Nothing had an alliance with Forever and
Everything to give life a new being as Present, showing him what is
Presence and in the land of life as it's known.

Ocean's mother is a delicate lady, with strong heart and strong beliefs.
Her ascendants were poor farmers when she was young. Her family moved to
the city after some time the farm was not productive anymore.

Ocean's father is a strong man, his ascendants origins from his homeland
founders, people from Ocean's family say they were indigens, in another
word, ancient people that used to live on that land. He had a big family
with at least 7 or 8 siblings.

Ocean's parents together built a love with Everything Forever. Together
they had a good younghood, with great challenges trying to help their
families. As the time went by, their families became a single big
family, a good love ground for their blessings.

In Present days Ocean and Tchesca, his mother, talked a lot about how
she met his father:

-   Tchesca: Your father was a young lad, not very handsome and had a
    funky style.

-   Ocean's: Mom, but if he was not handsome, what did you see on him?

-   Tchesca: I saw Everything, an opportunity to live a love story and
    travel the world collecting resources to help your grandmothers and
    grandfathers.

-   Ocean's: But he had a funky style.

-   Tchesca: Inside a man's heart there is more than what the body
    shows.

Ocean's parents have told a big Real Fairy Tale about their engagement.
A real big love that would be carried forever by a God of Love. From
this love was borth two little Girls, Ocean's sisters. One of the
sisters, Priscila was willing to have a little brother. Valkyrie, the
middle sister wanted no brothers or sisters anymore, a plea that was
useless as Ocean's mother was already waiting for him for couple months.

In this lovely family of four people, a fifth would have to come to add
more adventures. So meanwhile the two sisters were fighting for having
or not having a baby brother, the parents were taking care for the baby
arrival.

It was in a hospital, rainy day with much love, Ocean has come to this
world.
